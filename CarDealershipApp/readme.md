Car Dealership Project

Car Sales system is an application that computerizes the conventional car sale procedure which we are aware of. This is a Java/HTML based application. This helps in managing data related to buyers and sellers of the cars. Business reports can also be generated and viewed.

This program should handle a new and used vehicles inventory with minimum 10 cars. Every detail of a vehicle like manufacturer name, date of purchase, Kilo meters ran( in case of used vehicles), price, make/model, car description picture/s of the car etc.

If a user click to view details of a car we should display the car details :eg
name, model, year build, price, description, picture, etc...


If a car is sitting in inventory for more than 120 days, there is be an option to place a bid on the car.
Bidding cars can be sold at a discounted price up to 10% if and only if the dealership's purchase date is over 120 days.

The inventory should have minimum 3 cars with idle days of 120+.
The inventory should have an option to replenish the inventory by adding pictures and details of a car.

The application to have a reporting section which display information about all transactions made, including the person who purchase the car. 
This reporting page should order transaction by date starting with the most recent purchase.

A user should also be able to search for a type (model) car from the inventory.

The inventory should only have cars available to be sold. If a car has been sold 
the inventory should reflect this behavior. 

Note:
This system should have local storage of all sale transactions (save record to a file).
This should be loaded on every application load. This mean your application should keep a record of the transaction history even after it has been powered down. However leave this for last the priority level is low. We will learn how to use databases for saving data.

Bonus:
Add functionality to add a new car to the inventory including a display photo of the car.
